[{"id": 2, "title": "Roasted Asparagus", "description": "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Cut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard. With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears. Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt. With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt. Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them. They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning. They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal.", "image": "http://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_266/v1/img/recipes/50/84/7/picMcSyVd.jpg", "ingredients": " asparagus, olive oil, kosher salt", "favourite": true, "created_at": "2017-03-22T16:49:30", "updated_at": "2019-09-12T14:05:10", "notebook_id": 3}, {"id": 4, "title": "Big Night Pizza", "description": "Add hot water to yeast in a large bowl and let sit for 15 minutes.
